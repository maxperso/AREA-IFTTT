# Project AREA - Action REAction

## Overview

Project AREA is a comprehensive software suite designed to function similarly to popular automation platforms like IFTTT and Zapier. It is divided into three main components:

1. **Application Server**: Implements the core features of the project (see Features section).
2. **Web Client**: A browser-based interface to interact with the application server.
3. **Mobile Client**: A mobile application for convenient access and interaction with the application server.
